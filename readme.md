> A curated list of awesome real-life documentation examples 


## About

Once upon a time, I set out to find and share great examples of technical documentation over the web. But, couldn't find a single **awesome** _community-curated_ `resource` that provided great examples of docs categoried according to their usecases. Well, look no further for the awesome-documenation list here! And, we are looking for even more examples.

Below, you can find the table of contents with each heading in the list corressponding to an actual section of the documentation. In each of the headings contains examples of documentation that is equal parts captivating, interesting and inspiring for the readers. If code for the repository is open-source, it would be linked right next to it.

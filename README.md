## Motivation behind the list

Once upon a time, I set out to find a single **awesome** _community-curated_ `resource` that provided great examples of docs available all over the web. I couldn't find one and neither could my friend, Justin. So I created one and you are welcome! That's how awesome-documentation began.

🎯 Each item is categorized according to sections.
👌 Focused on providing concrete examples & great inspiration to fellow documentarians. 
📄 Some items feel they need to be there in other sections as well just because of how good they are but I want to keep duplicates to a minimum.
👂 Looking forward to any and all suggestions!

## All-stars of documentation!

> 🌟 The best of the best overall 🌟 

- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/resources/) - Gitlab's accurate docs coupled with the flow of information and scale they handle sets them apart to be a prime example for technical, non-technical as well as internal documentation. Their handbook, guides, tutorials are extremely well done. Look no further.
